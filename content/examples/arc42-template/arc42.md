# arc42 Template {discreet}

Based on the template from arc42. There is no better way to summarize the purpose:

> All you ever need to construct, **communicate and document your software architecture**. Proven, **practical and pragmatic**. Free and open source, **takes the pain out of documentation**. \([arc42.org](https://arc42.org/)\)

The 12 chapters of the template with introductory descriptions are created as `includes` and can be edited in a structured manner.

Good luck with creating your architectural documentation as it should be!
