>
> * underlying business goals, essential features and  functional requirements for the system,
> * `quality goal`{A quality goal is a high-level, measurable objective that defines a desired non-functional property of a software system e.g., performance, security, or maintainability and guides architectural decisions to achieve it.}s for the architecture,
> * relevant stakeholders and their expectations

## 1.1 Requirements Overview

> Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract) of requirements. Links to the (hopefully existing) requirements documents, with information where to find it.

## 1.2 Quality Goals

> The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Donâ€™t confuse them with project goals. They are not necessarily identical.

## 1.3 Stakeholders

> Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that
>
> * should know the architecture
> * have to be convinced of the architecture
> * have to work with the architecture or with code
> * need the documentation of the architecture for their work
> * have to come up with decisions about the system or its development
