# 10 Quality Requirements 

> This section contains all relevant quality requirements.
>
> The most important of these requirements have already been described in section 1.2. (quality goals), therefore they should only be referenced here. In this section 10 you should also capture quality requirements with lesser importance, which will not create high risks when they are not fully achieved (but might be nice-to-have).
