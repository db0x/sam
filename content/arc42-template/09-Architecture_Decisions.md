# 9 Architecture Decisions 

> Important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions including rationales. With “decisions” we mean selecting one alternative based on given criteria.
>
> Please use your judgement to decide whether an architectural decision should be documented here in this central section or whether you better document it locally (e.g. within the white box template of one building block). Avoid redundant texts. Refer to section 4, where you captured the most important decisions of your architecture already.
> A list of {ok}pro and {nok}contra arguments is a good idea to explain the decisions that have been made.
